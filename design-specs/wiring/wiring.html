	<P>Attached to this post are the updated wiring diagrams.<BR><BR>Here
	are the notes:<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>ASSEMBLY NOTES<BR><BR><BR>1.
	The Wave Articulation Matrix is composed of eight concentric
	cylinders of ferrous metal, such as iron, steel, or stainless
	steel.<BR><BR>2. All eight cylinders have equal mass and equal
	surface area.<BR><BR>3. The cylinders are whole circles -- they are
	not Split Ring Resonators. If a cylinder is made by rolling up a
	rectangle of metal foil, then the two meeting edges must be
	seam-welded, soldered, or connected with conductive glue.<BR><BR>4.
	The Wave Articulation Matrix can be described as a Log-Periodic
	structure, as in a &quot;Log Periodic Antenna&quot;. The Log Base
	used here is the Golden Ratio.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(c) Creative Commons

	CIRCUIT OPERATION<BR><BR>1. Capacitor C1 is charged through resistor
	R1 by the High Voltage Supply.<BR><BR>2. Because WAM cylinder zero
	(the innermost cylinder) is connected to the high voltage side of
	capacitor C1, and cylinder seven (the outermost cylinder) is held at
	a low voltage, an Electric Field exists in the space between these
	two cylinders.<BR><BR>3. When the pulse generator causes the Triode
	to go into conduction, this Electric Field collapses, producing wave
	phenomena. <BR>

<BR><b>4. The WAM can be thought of as a Nested Cylindrical Wave Guide, or 
        a Cavity Resonator.  
        Eric Dollard has suggested that it exists in the form of a
	Mode Changer. 
<p>
Normally we think of an antenna radiating TEM waves.  However, in a structure
such as this, we can have TEM, TE, and TM waves.  In a wave guide, it is 
possible for a wave to exist in which the Magnetic component of the wave is 
transverse to the direction of propagation, but the Electric component is 
longitudinal.  This is called a TM or Transverse Magnetic wave.  (See
Kiver, Milton S., "UHF Radio Simplified" 1945, pp. 102-104).
<p>
In a properly tuned cavity resonator, the Electric and Magnetic waves from
the excitation source, and their reflections from the walls, superimpose to
form standing waves.  These are very much akin to the Voltage Standing Waves
found on a Transmission Line when there is an impedance mismatch at the load.
We believe it would be well to study this structure in
terms of the standing waves it sets up in the volume of space which it 
occupies.

	<BR><BR>5. The pulse
	generator switches the Triode OFF, capacitor C1 charges up again,
	and the process repeats.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>FIRING CIRCUIT NOTES<BR><BR>1.
	The Spark Gap is merely a safety mechanism. It acts like a blow-off
	valve. Its purpose is to protect the Triode from being damaged,
	should an excessively high voltage develop on cylinder zero for some
	reason. The electrodes of the spark gap should be separated at a
	distance such that it will not fire during normal operation, but
	will discharge the voltage on cylinder zero should it exceed the
	maximum rated plate voltage of the Triode.<BR><BR>2. The bottom of
	the innermost cylinder (cylinder zero) is connected to capacitor C1.
	The top of this cylinder is connected to the Triode or Switching
	Device.<BR><BR>2. Cylinders 1-6 provide the output of the device.
	They may be tied together electrically.<BR><BR>3. Cylinder seven
	(the outermost cylinder) is connected to +12V positive bias.<BR><BR>4.
	The cathode of the Triode is not grounded. It is positively biased
	at +12V.<BR><BR>5. Capacitor C1 should be a vacuum capacitor, to
	allow for the most rapid discharge.<BR><BR>6. It is desirable that
	the Triode or Switching Device switch from OFF to ON as quickly as
	possible (fast rise time). What we wish to achieve is the sudden,
	rapid collapse of a strong Electric Field.<BR><BR>7. The Switching
	Device does not have to be a Triode. Any high voltage, high speed
	switching device will be appropriate.<BR><BR>8. The WAM can be
	scaled to any size. However, for practical sizes (for example,
	lambda = 60 cm) the waves generated will be in the microwave range.
	Therefore, the length of any connecting wires becomes
	significant.<BR><BR>9. Values for R1 and C1 should be chosen such
	that the capacitor's Time Constant allows it to be fully recharged
	in between discharge pulses.<BR><BR>10. The Pulse Generator can be a
	square wave generator operating at approximately 1-2 MHz. It is
	generally recognized that the 1.995-2.000 MHz HAM band is used for
	Experimental work. These frequencies are available to any operator
	holding a General Class or higher HAM license.<BR><BR>11. It may be
	necessarry to insert a non-inductive resistor between the top of
	cylinder zero, and the plate of the triode, in order to prevent too
	much plate current from flowing.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(c) Creative Commons
