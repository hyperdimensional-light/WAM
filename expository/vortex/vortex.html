<font size="+2">The Geometry of a Vortex</font>
<p>
<b>1. To Drive Down the Road, Your Wheels Must Spin in Only One Direction</b>
<br>
Imagine you are driving down the road. What would happen if
your wheels spun first one direction, then the other, then one way,
then the other? You wouldn&rsquo;t get very far.<BR><BR>To go down
the road, your wheels have to spin in only one direction: forward.
They must spin forward the first time, and every time after that.
They must never spin backwards at all. Then you will go down the
road.<BR><BR>

<b>2. To Build up Angular Momentum in a Flywheel, You Must Push it in Only One Direction</b>
<br>
Now let's say you have a flywheel. If you push
it first one way, then the other, then one way, then the other, it
will never get going, and spin on its own.<BR><BR>To get your
flywheel spinning, you must push it in only one direction, over and
over again. Then it will start spinning, and keep spinning all by
itself, in between pushes.<BR><BR>

<b>3. When Alternating Current Flows Through a Wire, the Magnetic Field Around the Wire Keeps Changing Direction</b>
<br>
When AC current flows through a
wire, the magnetic field around the wire spins first clockwise, then
counter-clockwise, then CW, then CCW. Of what does this remind
you?<BR><BR>Let's charge up a capacitor, and then discharge it
through a wire. If we do this over and over again, the magnetic field
around the wire will always spin in the same direction, just like
pushing on a flywheel in the correct way.<BR><BR>

<b>4. How to Create a Vortex in Water</b>
<br>
Now let&rsquo;s say you have a
bucket of water. If you put a stick in the water and stir first CW,
then CCW, then CW, then CCW &mdash; your water will just splash
around and make a mess.<BR><BR>But if you stir the water in only one
direction, say CCW, and keep stirring only in that direction, your
water will start to spin around. If you stir fast enough, your water
will form a whirlpool. Physicists call this whirlpool a VORTEX.<BR><BR>A
whirlpool is a vortex in water. A tornado is a vortex of air. You can
have a vortex in any continuous medium.<BR><BR>A vortex forms when
some stuff is spinning around, and the stuff near the center is
spinning faster than the stuff further out. This is different than
when a record spins on a turntable. When a record spins around, the
circumference spins faster than the middle part.<p>

<p>If you look
at your water vortex, you will see that it has a special shape, kind
of like a funnel. If you look at this funnel sideways, you will see
that its curves are hyperbolas. This funnel shape is called a
Hyperbolic Horn. This is the same shape as the WAM.<p>

<p>In the
WAM, the magnetic field always spins in the same direction (CCW as
viewed from above). The WAM creates a vortex in the medium through
which EM waves propagate. Faraday, Maxwell, Tesla and Lorentz called
this medium The Ether. Wilhelm Reich called it Orgone.</P>

<b>A Vortex, like a Fire, can Draw Energy into Itself and Grow</b>
<br>
A vortex is like a fire, in that, given the appropriate conditions, they 
both can draw energy from their environment into themselves, thus becoming
larger and more powerful.  Being larger and more powerful than they were 
before,  they are then able to draw even <i>more</i>
energy from their environment, and we have a chain reaction.
<p>
This process is called Growth, and is a characteristic of living things.
<p>
This could also be thought of as a recursive process.
<p>
Think of dropping a lit cigarette in a dry field.  Soon you have a wildfire.
How did all the energy in the wildfire come from that one little cigarette?
It didn't.  It came from the grassy field.  
<p>
If a vortex is properly formed and contained, and excited beyond a critical 
threshold, it will begin drawing energy into itself.  It is possible for
the vortex to draw more energy into itself than is necessarry to maintain 
it above this threshhold (i.e. the vortex is attempting to grow).  Some of
the excess energy can be siphoned off and put to useful purposes, while
the vortex continues to exist and maintain itself.  It's like milking a cow.
As long as the cow exists, and is able to draw energy from her environment 
(i.e. eat grass), you can milk her.
