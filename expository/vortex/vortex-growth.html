	<P>Part 1: Waves and Vortices<BR><BR>In a continuous medium, such as
	air, you can have waves. Sound waves are waves of air.<BR><BR>Light
	is also a wave, but it is not a wave of air. Light is a wave of
	Ether.<BR><BR>A vortex can form in air. A tornado is a vortex of
	air. A vortex can also form in Ether.<BR><BR>This technology creates
	a vortex in the Ether.<BR><BR>Part 2: What is a vortex?<BR><BR>When
	a record spins around on a turntable, the outside edge spins faster
	than the middle.<BR><BR>When air spins around in a tornado, the
	middle spins around faster than the outer edge.<BR><BR>A tornado is
	a vortex. A record is not.<BR><BR>A vortex may look like a spiral,
	but that is just an artefact created by the circular motion of the
	medium. The medium spins around in circles. It does not spiral
	towards the center.<BR><BR>When you stir water in a bucket, it makes
	a vortex. The vortex makes a funnel shape. If you look at this
	funnel from the side, it has the form of a hyperbolic horn. The
	bottom point of this horn is infinitely far below the surface of the
	water.<BR><B><BR>A vortex is like a fire, in that they can both draw
	energy from their environment into themselves, thus growing larger
	and more powerful, and then able to draw even *more* energy into
	themselves. etc.<BR><BR>This process is called Growth, and is a
	characteristic of living things, such as trees.</B></P>
