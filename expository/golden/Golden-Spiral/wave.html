Let.s make a Golden Spiral.

<p>

Technically, a Golden Spiral grows by a factor of Phi every quarter 
cycle. Each quarter cycle, the amplitude multiplies by Phi.
<p>
Phi = The Golden Ratio = (1 + sqrt(5) )/2 
<p>

Just to make things simple, let.s have 
our spiral grow by a factor of Phi each full cycle, instead of each 
quarter cycle.
<p>
Let.s also look at our spiral sideways, and allow it to exist in the dimension of time.

<p>

Each time the wave completes a cycle, the amplitude has multiplied by 
Phi. The envelope of this wave is an Exponential Curve: Phi^x 

<p>

Golden 
Spirals are found in many places in nature, where living things grow. 
This wave is experiencing Exponential Growth. Can our wave grow in any 
other ways? Yes, its frequency can grow as well as its amplitude. Let.s 
have the frequency grow in the same way as the amplitude. Each time the 
wave completes one cycle, its frequency will grow by a factor of Phi. 
That is, each time the wave completes a cycle, its Period will divide by 
Phi.
Now what does this wave look like?

This wave is a very special wave. It is like a Golden Spiral within a 
Golden Spiral. Because we have allowed the frequency to grow as well as 
the amplitude, the envelope of the wave is no longer an exponential 
curve. It is a Hyperbola.
<p>
An exponential curve can keep growing forever, and keep getting bigger and bigger. A Hyperbola, on the other hand, has an asymptote. 
<p>

<p>

What does this mean? It means this: A wave whose amplitude grows like a 
Golden Spiral (Exponential curve), can continue growing forever, and 
always remain finite.
<p>
A wave whose amplitude *and frequency* both grow like Golden Spirals will 
have a Hyperbolic envelope, not an Exponential one. That means that the 
wave will achieve an infinite amplitude within a finite amount of time. 
The amount of time required to do this is equal to the period of the wave 
which initiated the growth process, plus Phi times that period.

The geometry of the Wave Articulation Matrix is shaped like this wave.

The wave can also be flipped around. Now it is a "chirp".

Rotate the hyperbolic envelope of this wave around the z-axis to form a vortex.
