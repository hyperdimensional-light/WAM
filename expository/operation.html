<b>Key Operational Parameters</b>
<p>

A capacitor, charged to a high positive voltage, is discharged not to ground, but to a low positive voltage.
<p>
Ideally, this discharge is effected by a vacuum tube.  Solid state switching devices (i.e, Transistors) are not recommended.
<p>
The capacitor is charged again to a high positive voltage, and the process is repeated.
<p>
The capacitor can be charged through a resonant charging choke.<br>
In a pulse-forming network, the term used for this choke is "Resonant 
Charging Choke".  See the <a href="http://www.highvoltageprobes.com/_literature_89707/Pulsed_Power_Formulary">Northstar High Voltage Pulsed Power Formulary</a>.
